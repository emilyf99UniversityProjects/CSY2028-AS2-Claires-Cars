## Introduction
This project was completed as Part of Year Two of BSC Software Engineering at the University of Northampton.

It was part of the module CSY2038 - Web Programming and was an assessment on the ability to modify and improve PHP code on
an existing PHP/MySQL-driven website. Including a more secure development process than the previous assignment.

This project was weighted for 50% of the module grade. The other 50% is uploaded in a separate repository under the same module name.

## Brief (Summarised)
You are a developer for a web design agency and you have taken on a new client called
Claire’s Cars. Claire runs a small car dealership and the company’s website lets customers
see what she has for sale. Due to the nature of the business, customers like to view and test
drive the cars in person before buying so online purchasing is not a concern, the website just
acts as a catalogue. The website was developed several years ago by Claire’s nephew but is
now a little outdated and contains bugs that need fixing. 

Following on from this were 10 Core tasks. The goals of the assignment were to;
1. Complete the changes asked for by the client.
2. Rebuild the website in a manner that makes the code easier to maintain. At the moment
there is a lot of duplication and several bugs in the way the code is structured.
